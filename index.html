        I am a multidisciplinary designer with an interest in emerging

      </h3>

      <p class="details">
        I have had extensive experience in traditional field and design research
        in diverse contexts ranging from rural India to Urban Copenhagen.
        Currently, I am most interested in exploring the role of emerging
        technologies in developing new products and services, especially in the
        space of health (including mental health), sustainability, and mobility.
        In another life, I went to graduate school for Cognitive Science, and as
        such am quite interested in using decision-making and behavioral design.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time, I enjoy learning how to code especially using p5.js,
        and HTML/CSS. Infact this website, is an exercise in hand-coding.
